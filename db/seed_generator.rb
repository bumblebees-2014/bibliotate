THE TELL-TALE HEART

by Edgar Allan Poe
1843
TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story.

It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.

Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.

Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.

I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?"

I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.

Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.

When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.

It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.

And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.

But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more.

If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.

I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha!

When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.

I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.

The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.

No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!

"Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!"

I second this. The New York School of Poets also included Kenneth Koch, Frank O'Hara, and John Ashbery. These are pretty big names that definitely are still impacting young poets today. Ashbery won a Pulitzer and has, over time, won most of the American poetry prizes.
More recently, Stephen Dunn, Louise Gluck, W. D. Snodgrass, are all pretty big names. (And personal favorites of mine.) They're not as clearly affiliated with a school, but I personally believe that we're too close to them to really categorize them. Dunn and Gluck both won Pulitzers and both books are of course fantastic; "Different Hours" for Dunn and "The Wild Iris" for Gluck. Paul Muldoon and Dana Goia are big right now. I'm not a personal fan of Goia but both draw heavily on formal styles and rhyme.
Slam poetry is of course a big thing now. I'm not as well-versed there. Not to pun, or anything...If anything I would tell you to start by looking up some Rives videos online. (Pronounced "reeves.")
I think we're moving towards a lot of multi-culturalism in poetry and using poetry to speak to personal stories of race, gender, and sexuality. Examples of poets who I think do this who are "hot" right now include Terance Hayes, whose book Lighthead I think deserved a Pulitzer, Danez Smith (who is hot and "up and coming" off the presses right now, edits at Muzzle Magazine, recently featured in Poetry magazine as well as others - btw Hayes guest-edited a really great issue of Ploughshares) and Tracy K Smith who I do believe recently won a Pulitzer.
Not to say the Pulizter isn't the only poetry prize in the world but I guess I do pick up poetry books when I see they've won them.
We're also seeing trauma and war poets. Bob Hicok taught at VSU (still does) during the school shooting and wrote about it a lot in his book "Words for Empty, Words for Full." Brian Turner writes about being a vet in his two books "Here Bullet" and "Phantom Noise."
C. K. Williams is another big name although I lent someone his book and never got it back so I can't speak to it so much.
OP, consider that the briefest overview I can give you of the biggest (mostly) AMERICAN names in poetry in the past 50 years.

 I feel like consuming literary analysis is only possible when the audience all agrees to hold certain foundational principles regarding linguistics, aesthetics, politics, etc., and what keeps me off /r/books is the absolute hostility towards those principles that the average person seems to have. Even the most evacuated pure New Criticism requires that the reader believes texts are meaningful, and how often do we get the "blue curtains are blue curtains" rant on reddit.

  Since literary theory tends to have a fairly open definition of what constitutes a 'text', movies, television shows, and other types of media in general could bring in a bigger audience. While some may dismiss anything nearing cultural studies, multimodal texts such as films can have just as much depth and possibility of interpretation as literature does. People have already done this with shows such as Breaking Bad, I'm certain an online journal covering media like that would be popular.

That is an interesting question. I think its safe to say that what Lord Henry finds alluring in Dorian is physical, or what we would consider to be "outward," appearance. Harry reminds us early in the book that Dorian has the sort of beauty that need not be explained.
But I think the beauty that Harry are referring to here goes beyond what we might consider to me mere outward, physical pleasantness. Or, to put it more accurately, that outward, physical pleasantness itself represents the highest form of intellectual, aesthetic, and philosophical experience in his view. It might be easier to understand this idea if we can cast aside the notion that Henry is simply being vein or shallow. To Harry, outward appearance is paradoxically dives deepest into the truth of life. As Wilde writes in the Preface to the 1891 edition: "All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril." This is one of the key ideas of late 19th century English Aestheticism of the sort that Walter Pater prescribes in The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry (A book Wilde described as the "golden book") and that is represented in Huysmans's Au Rebours (The novel that most likely provided the inspiration for Dorian's "yellow book").

Wilde is definitely interested in this idea, but it goes back. The man who stands outside of traditional morals is, obviously, important to Nietzsche, but it was also a key problem for the Romantics: see Wordsworth's The Borderers, Blake's revolutionary texts, and especially Shelley's dramas and radical stuff. Wilde was obviously very influenced by the Romantics (at least one of Lord Henry's speeches start as quotations from Keats's letters and follows it up with a Wildean epigram; somebody in the novel mentions Wordsworth's "The Idiot Boy") and in Shelley in particular. So this sentiment could have popped up in any of those places, particularly in something like Shelley's The Cenci or Prometheus Unbound (incidentally, I think Wilde was in the audience for the first stage performance of The Cenci in...like...1886 or thereabouts).

 So I can't be overly helpful, because I am not aware of any relationship between Hemingway and any actual anarchists, and the only time I can think in his writing that he mentions them are in For Whom The Bell Tolls. And this probably isn't what you want to hear, but he had a pretty low opinion of them.
It would have been better for the town if they had thrown over twenty or thirty of the drunkards, especially those of the red-and-black scarves, and if we ever have another revolution I believe they should be destroyed at the start. But then we did not know this.
We know he is referencing anarchists specifically because red and black were the colors of the CNT-AIT, an anarchist group that was organized strongly in Barcelona and Catalonia, but probably less so elsewhere.
Basically his protagonist characters make the argument that the anarchists were a hindrance to the cause of fighting off fascism, which should serve as no surprise, as the ideas behind anarchism don't really lend themselves to well regimented combat units. In fact, the CNT did not allow anyone who was military, police or an employer be a member, so they probably had a huge handicap when it came down to fighting.
Here is something I found arguing that Hemingway was oversimplifying the situation. The author argues that the CNT were actually key to early revolutionary success and at least made an effort to be organized. Maybe Hemingway's quote references only rural anarchists and shouldn't be compared to CNT activity?
Lastly, and I don't mean to be preachy, but regardless of your political views, you are probably not an anarchist, especially if you are pursuing higher education. Unless you are attending The University of Mogadishu and majoring in preventing the development of a central government, you are probably a capitalist with alternative political views. In any event, I hope this helped.
